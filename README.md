## Data Science Projects, code, and notes while exploring and researching tools and techniques.
      --My goal is to convert central ideas into blog posts that summarize and condense the material. 

### For a presentation of the ideas, see my blog at https://heuristics909.blogspot.com/


These notebooks were created to explore concepts, play with ideas, and domonstrate through applied mini projects what was learned along the way. As such, some of these notebooks are raw and messy. Throughout you will see notes about what I learned and challenges I came upon while implementing the concepts. Partly they document my journey in learning data science.
