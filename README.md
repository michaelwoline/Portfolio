# Notes, projects, and code while exploring data science.
###    --My goal is to convert central ideas into blog post. 

## Organized in 2 folders
###    --Notes, projects and code - This is the raw notes and code and mini projects that demonstrate ideas learned.
###    --Blog Source - As I create blogs and organize the raw notes, I will move them to this folder. 

## For a presentation of the ideas, see my blog at https://heuristics909.blogspot.com/


These notebooks were created to explore concepts, play with ideas, and domonstrate through applied mini projects what was learned along the way. As such, some of these notebooks are raw and messy. Throughout you will see notes about what I learned and challenges I came upon while implementing the concepts. Partly they document my journey in learning data science.
