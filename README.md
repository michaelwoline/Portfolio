# portfolio of data science studies and projects

These notebooks were created to explore concepts, play with ideas, and domonstrate through applied mini projects what was learned along the way. As such, some of these notebooks are raw and messy. Throughout you will see notes about what I learned and challenges I came upon while implementing the concepts. Partly they document my journey in learning data science.
